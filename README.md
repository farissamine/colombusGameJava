# colombusGameJava



This was the largest project that I had worked on up to my sophomore year of college. It was an independent assignment for an object-oriented programming class that I took in 2018 [SE 350] during my 2nd quarter of my 2nd year at DePaul University. This project is written in java using the Eclipse IDE. The project is just a simple game which uses the javafx library to implement a GUI. This project requirements included:
  
  -use of basic genre of game that was given to us
  
  -implementation of at least 4 object oriented design patterns in whatever way we please
  
    -Decorator Design pattern: I used Decorator to add power ups to the player
    
    -Singleton Design pattern: I used singleton to create one instance of the OceanMap which holds the state of the game
    
    -Factory Design patttern: I used factory to create all Entities of different types (Powerups, Ships/Pirate Ships, Monsters)
    
    -Strategy Design pattern: (Not implemented correctly) But intention was to allow for strategy of different Pirate and monster types
